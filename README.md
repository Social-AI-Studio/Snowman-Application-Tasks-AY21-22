## Welcome Note

First of all, thank you for applying to be my PhD student! I am glad that you have made the decision to explore graduate studies at this phase of your life, and I hope that I can be part of your research journey. However, I have received quite many applications every year, and it is impossible for me to accept all of you. Therefore, I have created two tasks to help me understand your strength and suitability to join my research team. The two tasks also give you a flavor of my research interests and what you will be doing as my graduate student. As I was also once a graduate student, I know doing a PhD is a major decision as you will be spending a good 3-5 years of your life on this graduate program. So it is very important that you like what you do or at least have an idea of what you will be doing in the program.

Do note that completing the two tasks does not guarantee your acceptance into the SUTD PhD program! Officially, you can submit your application through the school's [website](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/education/phd/phd-application-process/). You may also want refer to this [websites](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Graduate/Scholarships) to find out the scholarship and fellowship available to support your graduate studies.

Should you have any questions on the following two tasks, please drop me an email: roy_lee@sutd.edu.sg.

## Task 1: Automated Hate Speech Detection

The sharp increase in online hate speeches has raised concerns globally as the spread of such toxic content and misbehavior have not only sowed discord among individuals or communities online but also resulted in violent hate crimes. Therefore, it is a pressing issue to detect and curb hate speech in online social media. In this task, you are required to detect hateful content in a publicly available Twitter dataset from the [notable work by Wazeem and Hovy (2016)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-2013.pdf). 


You are given the following files in *dataset* folder:
*  **train.csv**: A list of tweets with their respective labels. Use this dataset to train your machine learning models.
*  **test.csv**:  A list of tweets with their respective labels. Use this dataset to test your machine learning models.

You are required to report your models' precision, recall, and F1 scores on the test dataset.

**Deliverable**: Submit your Jupyter Notebook/Python codes with your implementation and arrange a date where we can skype to discuss your solution.

Note that I am not just looking at the best performance. I am more interested in your thinking process. Specifically, I will like to know the following:

*  How do you approach this problem?
*  How you decide which link prediction models to implement?
*  How you interpret your results?

This task gives you a sneak preview on what you will be working on after joining my research team. You will be building novel machine learning algorithms, writing codes, designing experiments to evaluate your models, analyzing results, etc. If you find this task fun, then yes, you are the right student, and I am your right supervisor :)


## Task 2: Reading Presentation

You would be invited to work on task 2 if you had performed task 1 well! I will send an email to invite you to perform task 2 and coordinate a Skype meeting for you to present the deliverables.

Pick one of the following research papers an present it to me. You are welcome to create slides to aid you in this presentation.

**Deliverable**: Present the paper during the coordinated Skype meeting. Note that you might be asked questions on Task 1 in this interview. 

The purpose of this task is to let you know that as my graduate student, you are required to do tons of readings like this. There will be times where you have absolutely no clue what the paper is talking about as it gets very technical, and this exercise challenges you to think of ways to overcome this problem. Don't worry, I will teach you how to overcome this when you enroll in the program, but before that, I will leave you to think of creative solutions to complete this task :)
